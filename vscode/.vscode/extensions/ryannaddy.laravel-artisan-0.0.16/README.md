## Usage

Once you have installed the extension, it will become active once you open a workspace that has `artisan` within the root directory.
You can then open the command pallet, and start running the commands.
Just type `Artisan:` to get a list of commands.

Many commands have optional input questions, leave them blank to use the defaults, or enter your own value.

All commands are accessable through `Artisan: Run Command`, here you can access your custom commands as well as built in commands.
